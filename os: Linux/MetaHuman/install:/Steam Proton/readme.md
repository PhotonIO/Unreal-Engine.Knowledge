>Workaround for Linux using Steam Proton Experimental:
>So I have a version of UE 5.6 running through steam proton experimental. I was able to create metahumans using that without problems. The epic games launcher works also. There is some lag with animations or tool-tips in the unreal editor. I was able to make Metahumans then rig them to the 3rd person template. I just couldnâ€™t use a c++ template because it needs visual studio. I tried my best to get visual studio working in proton experimental but had no luck.
