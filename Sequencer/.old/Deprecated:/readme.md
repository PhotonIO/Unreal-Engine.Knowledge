# A.I. Google Gemini:
>The "Render Movie" option in Sequencer within Unreal Engine has been deprecated as of Unreal Engine 5.0. This means it is no longer the recommended or supported method for rendering cinematic sequences to a movie file.
>
>Instead of the deprecated "Render Movie" option, users are now advised to utilize the Movie Render Queue (MRQ) system. MRQ offers a more robust and feature-rich pipeline for rendering high-quality cinematics and images, providing greater control over output settings, anti-aliasing, and various render passes.
>
>While the deprecated "Render Movie" option may still be present in older projects or specific workflows, it is crucial to transition to Movie Render Queue for new projects and to ensure compatibility and access to the latest rendering capabilities in Unreal Engine.
